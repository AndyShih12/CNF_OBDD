Hi Arthur,

Thanks a lot, I managed to get the python version working. It's actually 
pretty easy so I'll give you the steps to do it (in ubuntu).

1) installed swig and made the interface file (in attachment)
2) swig -python sdd.i
3) gcc -fpic -c sdd_wrap.c -I/usr/include/python3.2mu/
     (change with your own path to python.h)
4) ld -shared sdd_wrap.o -Llib -lsdd -lm -lpython3.2mu -XLinker -rpath lib -o _sdd.so
     (in my case lib is the directory containing libsdd.so and python3.2mu is the version I'm compiling for)

After this, just open python, import sdd and you can use the entire 
library.

Cheers,
Joris
